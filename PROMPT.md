study specs/README.md
study specs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and pick the most important task to do and work on it

use i18n-turkish-locale.md to stay in context of our localization
use sap-hana if you need database discovery (use subagents with detailed prompts to not bloat context)
create tests before implementation (if not already covered)
author property based tests or unit tests or use playwright cli for app functions (which ever is the best)
study existing code before implementing
after making changes to files run the tests
when tests pass, commit and mark the task complete in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, dont move to the next task!

IMPORTANT:
only make a PR when all tasks are completed in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN
